# Lara's Cards

Welcome to my app!\
It's called Lara's Cards. It will enable the user to send styled e-cards. There are several different types of pre-made e-cards to choose from with the ability to insert custom messages.
I built this app when I could not find any free e-card providers to send e-cards to my friends. So I built one myself.\
I hope you enjoy using it :)

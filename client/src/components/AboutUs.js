				Hello! My name is Lara and I like to code ðŸ’». This is a project I did
				for my final project for my bootcamp.
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph>
				When I was looking for ideas as to what to build I remembered that
				recently I tried sending a ðŸ’Œ to my friend but all available options
				required ðŸ’°. Being excited to show off my newly polished coding skills
				and a supporter of free accessible technology for everyone, I thought
				that if it doesn't exist I can create it myself ðŸ’…. This is what came
				out of this idea.
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph>
				I hope you find it useful! If you would like to see other projects from
				me please refer to my portfolio below at the footer ðŸ˜‰
